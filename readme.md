During this project, the objective was to show off HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT skills learned through a web app.

This frontend web app has CSS and HTML throughout the project.

There is a home page, about page, and service page for a fake company in need of new customers.

The product being sold is Sheldon J. Plankton's invention of the Chum Bucket Helmets.

This was a great idea that only popularized in the Bikini Bottom but shortly ended due to complications. 

I believed that what Sheldon Plankton was missing was a wider, more open audience to get his product back off the ground.

So, with that information, I decided to make a website on Mr. Plankton's behalf.

Feel free to view the website to learn more information.
